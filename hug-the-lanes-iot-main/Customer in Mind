Given that the Driver is truly the customer of the your product,  how did you make sure that the driver has received the best information in the best format to safely drive the car, in particular an effective Interface (Display). Name the document "Customer in Mind"
By keeping the Driver Display as simple as possible, there is no unnecessary data being displayed at any given time, keeping the driver’s eyes on the road. The most recent, relevant update is the only message on the driver’s display unless the Lane Detection or Collision Detection System needs to display information to the driver. In that case, the Lane Detection and Collision Detection System have priority over other functions such as the Virtual Assistant. Maintaining simplicity within our design and displaying only the most important information keep the driver’s eyes on the road, therefore making the driver’s experience as safe as possible.
